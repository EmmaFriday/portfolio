## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Next.js 16 over Astro (pervasive interactivity makes islands architecture counterproductive)
- [Roadmap]: Three-tier CSS token system as the architectural foundation for dual-mode theming
- [Roadmap]: Content pipeline reads from toolkit repo at build time (portfolio never stores its own content copy)
- [01-01]: Single tokens.css file with three tiers (primitives in @theme, semantics in :root/[data-theme])
- [01-01]: text-muted token (~3.0:1) restricted to decorative content only, not WCAG AA compliant
- [01-01]: Blocking theme init script deferred to Plan 02 per plan specification
- [01-02]: Inline styles with var() for layout components rather than Tailwind arbitrary values
- [01-02]: Blocking script defaults to light theme and clears localStorage when no ?mode= param
- [01-02]: --bg-header semantic token for frosted glass header backgrounds

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Two-repo content pipeline: the exact mechanism for making toolkit content available during Vercel builds needs a concrete decision during Phase 2 planning (git submodule, content snapshot, or API)
- Sci-fi character illustration: dark mode will use a placeholder until Marie creates/commissions the art
